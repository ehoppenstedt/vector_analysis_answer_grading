# Converting Text Answers to Vectors for test grading automation
This colab is a (failed) attempt to transform student's answers to vectors (arrays) and then use the euclidian distance between vectors to determine whether an answer is correct or false. No useful results were obtained but it was a fun project so I am saving it here.
The algorithm works but the results are garbage, could be becuase of the metrics used, a failed theory or simply (very probable) garbage data.
